# techindicators
Python functions to calculate technical indicators from stock price data using Numpy.

## Purpose

These Python functions calculate various technical indicators from price time series data of stocks or other securities. The price data must be supplied as Numpy arrays and the functions rely on Numpy for calculations.  The code was written for those who would rather use Numpy matrices and arrays rather than Pandas dataframes for calculations.

## Using the functions

The documentation file has a list of the included function names along with a brief description of their use.  Links are provided in the documentation files for obtaining more information.  An example Jupyter notebook has been created to demonstrate the use of the functions, plotting data, and printing results.  To use the example notebook, download the following three files: techindicators.py, example_data.csv, and example_notebook.ipynb.  Place all three files in the same directory.  Then, open the example notebook file using the Jupyter client in order to execute and modify the code in the notebook file.

NOTE: You must first have Numpy, Matplotlib, Jupyter, and Datetime modules installed, and the Python code was developed using Python version 3.6.
